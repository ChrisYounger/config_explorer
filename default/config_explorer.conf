write_access = false
# This enables saving, creating new files/folders, deleting and renaming. This

# Enables running commands in the shell, with the user that splunk runs as.
# if you thought being able to edit the filesystem was dangerous, then this

# Defaults to false

lock_config = false
# Setting this to true will lock the config and it will not be possible to 
# change it without going onto the filesystem and changing it there.  
# Locking config will set write_access and run_commands to false
# Defaults to false
